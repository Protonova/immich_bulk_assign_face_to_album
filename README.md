## üéØ Overview
This script allows you to bulk assign your favourite pet or person to all assets within a specified album. It's perfect for scenarious where you have a curated album where you want to quickly add a face to all images.

I recently migrated from Google Photos to Immich: the built-in face recognition doesn't always work perfectly, especially with pets. If you have albums from Google Photos where most images contain a specific person or pet, this script can bulk assign that face to all assets in the album that don't already have it.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Bulk Face Assignment**: Add a person/pet to multiple images at once
- **Smart Filtering**: Only processes images that don't already have the target person/pet
- **API Validation**: Validates server connection, API key, album, and person IDs
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays and retry logic to be respectful to your server and reverse proxy
- **Progress Tracking**: Verbose debug output to track progress
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network errors and timeouts

## üîë Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended) or pip for dependency management
- An Immich server with API access
- Valid Immich API key
- Album ID and Person ID you want to work with
- Ownership of recipient Album

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone or download the script**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Protonova/immich_bulk_assign_face_to_album.git
   cd bulk-add-faces-to-images
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies using UV**
   
   UV is a fast Python package installer and resolver. It provides better dependency resolution and faster installs. Dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml`.
   
   ```bash
   # Install UV if you haven't already
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv sync
   ```

   Or if you prefer pip:
   ```bash
   pip install requests click
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Command

**Using UV (recommended):**
```bash
uv run bulk_add_faces_to_images.py --server https://your_immich_server.com --key your_api_key --person person_id --album album_id
```

**Using Python directly:**
```bash
python bulk_add_faces_to_images.py --server https://your_immich_server.com --key your_api_key --person person_id --album album_id
```

### With Debug Output

**Using UV:**
```bash
uv run bulk_add_faces_to_images.py --server https://your_immich_server.com --key your_api_key --person person_id --album album_id --debug
```

**Using Python directly:**
```bash
python bulk_add_faces_to_images.py --server https://your_immich_server.com --key your_api_key --person person_id --album album_id --debug
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `--server` | ‚úÖ | Your Immich server URL (e.g., `https://immich.domain.com`) |
| `--key` | ‚úÖ | Your Immich API key |
| `--person` | ‚úÖ | ID of the person you want to add to images |
| `--album` | ‚úÖ | ID of the album containing the target images |
| `--debug` | ‚ùå | Enable verbose debug output |

### Getting IDs

**Finding Album IDs:**
1. Go to your Immich web interface
2. Navigate to the desired album
3. Check the URL: `https://your_immich_server.com/albums/{album-id}`

**Finding Person IDs:**
1. Go to People section in Immich
2. Click on the person
3. Check the URL: `https://your_immich_server.com/people/{person-id}`

## üí° Example Use Case

**Scenario**: You imported photos from Google Photos and have an album called "My Dog Rex" with 2000+ photos (don't judge lol). Immich's face recognition missed 70% of the images of Rex...

**Solution**:
1. Create or identify the pet "Rex" in Immich
2. Grab the album ID and person ID
3. Run the script to bulk assign Rex's face to all images/videos in that album

```bash
uv run bulk_add_faces_to_images.py \
  --server https://photos.mydomain.com \
  --key 1234567890abcdef \
  --person abc123-def456-ghi789 \
  --album xyz789-uvw456-rst123 \
  --debug
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Imposed Query Limit**: The script processes only the first 50 assets in an album (for testing purposes, will remove in future)
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes 0.1-second delays between requests to avoid overwhelming your server
- **Backup Recommended**: Always backup your Immich database before running bulk operations
- **Test First**: Try with a small album first to ensure everything works as expected

## üîß Current Limitations & TODOs

This is an alpha version with several planned improvements:

- [ ] Code cleanup and better commenting
- [ ] Improved variable naming
- [ ] Proper variable initialization
- [ ] Enhanced error handling and logging
- [ ] Remove hardcoded 50-asset limit
- [ ] Session management across all requests
- [ ] Break logic into more focused functions
- [ ] Performance optimizations
- [ ] Better progress indicators

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**401 Unauthorized Error**
- Verify your API key is correct/valid
- Check that your API key has the necessary permissions (ie, don't have access to the )

**Album/Person Not Found**
- Double-check the IDs from your Immich web interface
- Ensure the album and person exist in your Immich instance

**Connection Timeouts**
- The script includes retry logic, but if you have a slow connection, you may need to increase timeout values
